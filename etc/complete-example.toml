#
# This is a "complete" Grit configuration file.
# By default, Grit looks for this file at ~/.config/grit.toml
#
# It is written in TOML - https://github.com/toml-lang/toml
# All directives have sensible defaults... well, I think they're sensible.
#

#
# The clone section controls how Grit clones from your Git sources.
#
[clone]

# "root" is the base directory for all Git clones created via Grit.
#
# The target directory is <root>/<git host>/<repo slug>.
#
# The slug is simply the path portion of the Git URL, without the .git
# extension, or any other extension.
#
# For example, using a
# root of "~/grit" (which happens to be the default), the command:
#
#   grit clone jmalloc/grit
#
# Will clone git@github.com:jmalloc/grit.git to ~/grit/github.com/jmalloc/grit
root = "~/my-repos"

# "default-branch" is is used when cloning an empty repo.
#
# This is "main" on github.com, but "master" by convention elsewhere,
# you can override the default of "main" here.
default-branch = "main"

# "clone.sources" is a list of additional Git sources.
#
# The key is an arbitrary label for the source. It can be used when cloning to
# force Grit to clone from a specific source.
#
# The value is a template for Git URL. The string {{slug}} is substituted with
# the "<slug>" command-line argument.
#
# Environment variables can also be injected into the URL template using
# the syntax {{env `VARNAME`}}. See https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
# for documentation about the templating system.
#
# The sources list always includes an implicit 'github' entry, which uses
# the URL "git@github.com:{{slug}}.git". This can be explicitly overriden if
# you wanted to use the HTTPS URLs instead, for example.
[clone.sources]
my-company = "git@github.example.com:{{slug}}.git"

#
# The index section controls how Grit indexes your Git clones.
#
[index]

# "paths" is an array of directories that are scanned (recursively) when
# performing a complete rebuild of the index.
#
# The default value is an array containing the value of the "clone.root"
# configuration directive, which itself defaults to "~/grit".
#
# Cloning a repository using Grit *always* adds that repository to the index,
# even if it's not inside any of the configured index paths. However, any
# repositories outside the index paths will be removed from the index if the
# index is rebuilt.
paths = ["~"]

# "store" is the location of the index database.
# If no path is specified, the index database is stored in the clone.root
# directory in a file named "index.v2".
store = "/path/to/the/index"
